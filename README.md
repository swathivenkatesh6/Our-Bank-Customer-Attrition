# Our-Bank-Customer-Attrition

Background: OurBank is an Australian retail bank that offers customers a range of products and services,
including loans, credit cards, transaction and savings accounts. It has one of the largest branch
and ATM networks, and prides itself on being a bank that consumers can trust.
OurBank offers four types of credit cards, ranging in the services provided with each product.
These are ranked from their most basic Blue, to Silver, Gold and finally to their most expensive
and high-touch Platinum product.

Problem Statement: OurBankâ€™s consumer credit card business manager is concerned about their customer attrition:
Customers keep moving to other banks and leaving OurBank in their dust. This is a big problem,
because they know it costs a lot more money to get new customers than it does to retain existing
customers.
They want to analyse the data to find out the reason behind this, predict future customers who
might leave, and to determine whether or not there are strategies they can use to encourage
existing customers to stay. They also want to know if they can improve the data they collect in
any way.
